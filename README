SUPPORT TOOLS FOR CLION
Here are a couple of scripts which make the CLion IDE nicer to use. They basically replicate the
build process used by CLion itself, from the command-line, allowing the build and test process to
be run from the command-line. There's also a mkproj.sh script that can generate ready-made CLion-
compatible minimal projects.

1) Install CLion from https://www.jetbrains.com/clion (e.g to ${HOME}/clion-2016.3).

2) Install GoogleTest:

  wget --no-check-certificate -qO- https://github.com/google/googletest/archive/release-1.8.0.tar.gz | tar zxf -
  cd googletest-release-1.8.0/googletest
  ${HOME}/clion-2016.3/bin/cmake/bin/cmake .
  make
  sudo cp libgtest*.a /usr/lib/
  sudo cp -r include/gtest /usr/include/
  cd ../..
  rm -rf googletest-release-1.8.0

3) Install report-generation tools:

  sudo apt-get install lcov xsltproc

4) Now you can easily create ready-made minimal projects that can be loaded into CLion. You might
want to edit the mkproj.sh script to choose a different compiler (I'm using a local build of
gcc/6.2.0 located in ${HOME}/gcc):

  mkdir -p ${HOME}/ClionProjects
  cd ${HOME}/ClionProjects
  mkproj.sh fred
  cd fred
  build.sh debug
  cmake-build-debug/fred     # run compiled executable
  gtest.sh debug unit-tests  # run tests, view test & coverage reports

Have fun!
