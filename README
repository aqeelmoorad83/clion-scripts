SUPPORT TOOLS FOR CLION

Here are a couple of scripts which make the CLion IDE nicer to use. They basically replicate the
build process used by CLion itself, from the command-line, allowing the build and test process to
be run from the command-line. There's also a mkproj.sh script that can generate ready-made CLion-
compatible minimal projects.

1) Download CLion and install it (e.g to ${HOME}/clion-2016.3):

  https://www.jetbrains.com/clion 

2) Install report-generation tools:

  sudo apt-get install lcov xsltproc

3) Grab GoogleTest & GoogleMock:

  mkdir -p ${HOME}/ClionProjects
  cd ${HOME}/ClionProjects
  wget --no-check-certificate -qO- https://github.com/google/googletest/archive/release-1.8.0.tar.gz | tar zxf -

4) Now you can easily create ready-made minimal projects that can be loaded into CLion. You might
want to edit the mkproj.sh script to choose a different compiler (I'm using a local build of
gcc/6.2.0 located in ${HOME}/gcc):

  cd ${HOME}/ClionProjects
  mkproj.sh fred
  cd fred
  build.sh debug
  cmake-build-debug/fred     # run compiled executable
  gtest.sh debug unit-tests  # run tests, view test & coverage reports

5) These minimal projects can also be built in MSVC++:

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 14 Win64" -Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON
  MSBuild.exe unit-tests/unit-tests.vcxproj
  unit-tests/Debug/unit-tests.exe

Have fun!
